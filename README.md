## Phase 1

### Objectives
- Reduce reduce strength of differential glasses, eliminate them
- Discover active focus

On 2022 Apr 11, I hung up an eyechart and began consistently practicing active focus with it.

### Result
Spherical reduction from -4.25 in both eyes to -3.25 in both eyes.

### Reflection
I reduced my differentials too rapidly - I thought my eyesight was improving quickly but in reality it was blur adaptation fooling me. Also, I did not wear normalized glasses outdoors - I should have. These mistakes are addressed in the next phase.

## Phase 2

### Objectives
- Gradually reduce strength of differential glasses (at an appropriate pace this time!) until I no longer need them to do computer work
- Wear normalized glasses outdoors, gradually reduce their strength
